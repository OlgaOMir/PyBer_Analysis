# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to provide the CEO and the executive team of PyBer ridesharing corporation with the ride-sharing data by city type. Using Pandas libraries, the Jupyter Notebook, and Matplotlib I was able to create a multiple-line graphs highliting the relationshipt between the type of city and the total weekly fares. The analysis will be used to address any disparities amonth the city types and will aid the CEO and the executive team in finalizing a strategic plan. 

## Results

There is a noticeable imbalance among the urban, suburban and rural cities when it comes to the total weekly fares. Based on the initial analysis of the provided data set, the total numbers of rides and drives in rural areas is significantly smaller compared to urban and suburban cities.

## Summary

Below are three business recommendations to the CEO to addressing the disparities described above:
  
  1. the executive team needs to increase the number of drivers in rural cities
  2. gathering additional data on the duration of the ride-sharing trip based on the city type, which would further aid in understanding of the disparities and help share the overall corporate strategy
  3. gathering information on the amount of fare requests would assist in understanding if the driver numbers adequatey represent the demand for rides
